        <div >India is one of the most beautiful countries in the world and is best known for its colourful culture and fascinating heritage. Its grand monuments, like the Taj Mahal act as strong pillars of the rich and deep history that India possesses. From their splendid architecture to a strong legacy, the historical monuments of India speak volumes. Most of these Indian monuments were primarily built under the regime of Rajputana, Dravidian and Mughal emperors. The monuments of India are speaking stones of the glory of its rulers and the brilliance of artisans in ancient India. Due to the incredible beauty of India and the constant efforts of the government in maintaining the heritage sites, India tourism has flourished rapidly witnessing an increase in the number of travellers from all around the world. Some of the well-preserved monuments in the different parts of the country are Red Fort (North), Sun Temple Konark (East), Amer Fort (West) and Charminar (South).

            This victory tower is a symbol of the synthesis of traditional Islamic 
            architecture and Southwestern Asian design. Elizabeth Lambourn’s Islam Beyond 
            Empires: Mosques and Islamic Landscapes in India and the Indian Ocean studies 
            the introduction of Islam in South Asia and how the region influenced the 
            Islamic religious architecture.[13] These newly arrived Muslims from the
            Islamic West escaped the Mongol Empire and emigrated to India, where they
            constructed religious centers. The Qutb Minar serves as a central marker 
            to these new Muslim communities as well as being a reminder of Islam's presence 
            in the area.[13] The architecture of the minaret varies greatly from that of the
            typical style and design of the mosques constructed in the Middle East. The 
            style of these structures is heavily influenced by the local architecture such
            as the Indic temples. This affected the different materials, techniques, and 
            decoration that were used in the construction of the Qutb Minar </p>

The fort’s massive red sandstone walls, which stand 75 feet (23 metres) high, enclose
a complex of palaces and entertainment halls, projecting balconies, baths and indoor canals,
and geometrical gardens, as well as an ornate mosque. Among the most famous structures
of the complex are the Hall of Public Audience (Diwan-i-ʿAm), which has 60 red sandstone
pillars supporting a flat roof, and the Hall of Private Audience (Diwan-i-Khas), which is 
smaller and has a pavilion of white marble.</p>

            <P >The Taj Mahal was commissioned by Shah Jahan in 1631, to be built in the 
                memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal, who died on 17 June that year, while giving 
                birth to their 14th child, Gauhara Begum.[14][15] Construction started in 
                1632,[16] and the mausoleum was completed in 1648, while the surrounding 
                buildings and garden were finished five years later.[17] The imperial court 
                documenting Shah Jahan's grief after the death of Mumtaz Mahal illustrates
                the love story held as the inspiration for the Taj Mahal.[18] According to 
                contemporary historians Muhammad Amin Qazvini, Abdul Hamid Lahori and
                Muhammad Saleh Kamboh, he did not show the same level of affection to others 
                as he had shown her while she was alive. He avoided royal affairs for a week 
                due to his grief, along with giving up listening to music and dressing 
                lavishly for two years. Shah Jahan was enamored by the beauty of the land at
                the south side of Agra on which a mansion belonging to Raja Jai Singh I
                stood. This place was chosen for the construction of Mumtaz's tomb by Shah 
                Jahan and Jai Singh agreed to donate it to the emperor</P>
